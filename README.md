# Slide
## A python/pygame time waster, like the traditional 4x4 number tile game.
### Put the numbers in order, with the empty tile in the bottom right.

The game keeps track of your moves and the time it takes you complete a randomly generated winnable puzzle.

Use WASD or click to move the tiles around.
